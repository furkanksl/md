# My Drawer

> The missing AI layer of macOS. An intelligent sidebar that blends into your desktop to help you chat with AI, track your clipboard, and organize windows without breaking your flow.

## Project Summary
My Drawer (md) is a native macOS application designed to integrate AI workflows directly into the operating system's UI. It functions as a collapsible sidebar that provides instant access to LLMs, clipboard history, and productivity tools, ensuring 100% local privacy and a seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- **Context-Aware AI**: Chat with top models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o) or local LLMs (Mistral, Llama) with drag-and-drop context.
- **Clipboard History**: A persistent, searchable history of your copy-paste actions, supporting images and rich text.
- **Window Management**: Organize your workspace with "Window Flow" layouts and snapshots.
- **Privacy First**: Built with a local-first architecture. Your keys, your data.
- **Zero Clutter**: Auto-hides when not in use, appearing only when you need it.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Rust (Tauri v2), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Design System**: "Warm Minimalist" / "Zen" aesthetic (Charcoal #44403C, Off-White #FAF9F6, Sage Green #738F82).
- **License**: Open Source (MIT).
